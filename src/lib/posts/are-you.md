Friends, we at Pointless Project believe in one thing above all else: that which can be replaced by technology should be.

For too long, significant and meaningful life change lay beyond a barrier of hard work and harder decisions. Pointless Project seeks to bring all those benefits to you effort-free.

Today, we are pleased to announce our drop-in replacement of daily mindfulness practice, Are You. Have you ever wanted to start practicing daily mindfulness but were put off by the idea of spending as long as ten minutes a day alone with your thoughts?

Are You brings you all the benefits of daily mindfulness practice with none of the inconvenience. Are You is not just a new way to practice mindfulness; it is a complete replacement of daily mindfulness practice designed from first principles to achieve the same results.

The only thing you need to do to unlock the benefits of daily mindfulness is to <a href="https://bobbypalmer.dev/posts/are-you">download our app</a>.

And that's it.

When you open the Are You app, our beautiful interface allows you to set an interval in which your Are You message is displayed to you, a regular reminder to stay on track the same way you would remember if you spent every day meditating!

Never sit still with only your own thoughts for company again- that's the Are You promise.
