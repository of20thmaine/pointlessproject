description: One day I would like to write a product review for being a human being.

If everything I believe in is wrong, then it is possible that at some point in our existences we were discorporated souls floating around somewhere. Maybe we had some choice in what sort of being we got to be incorporated into? I like to imagine the options selection being akin to a page of Amazon search results for the term "sentient being."

If this were the case, then the product page for humanity was probably like that of a suspiciously low-priced Amazon product page from a brand name you have never heard of with zero reviews (this carries the implication that we are all the incorporated souls of stingy gamblers- rather fitting).

Carrying the metaphor too far, I imagine that whatever conveyance took us to Earth was in terrifyingly poor condition and that right before crashing into the Earth's surface, a low-quality tannoy system played out the famous line, "Thank you for choosing human, we know you had your choice in sentient species to be, and it looks like you made the wrong one."

What I hope is that if all this is true, at some point in the future, there will be an opportunity to write a review of the human experience- one which would serve as a warning to other discorporated souls. Assuming, of course, that the human listing hadn't already been removed for being fraudulent or deleting itself out of existence.

There are many things I would like to put in that review, but as is most often the case, our reviews tend to emphasize the thing that most recently annoyed us. And so, if written today, my review would be titled, "Thinking doesn't look productive" (2/5).

Not only does thinking not look productive, but the way it physically manifests, sitting or standing around seemingly doing nothing, actually looks unproductive!

Now, why is this a problem?

Looking productive has become society's yardstick for… everything. How productive you look is how good you are as a manager, a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer… If looking productive is good, looking unproductive is bad. If thinking looks unproductive, thinking is bad. But, thinking is not bad, hence the problem.

Why do I think looking productive has become society's yardstick?

What would a society look like if that were the case? I imagine that in such a society there would be an ever-increasing incentive structure for having completed projects, coupled with an ever-shrinking disincentive structure for broken and failed projects.

I imagine that in such a society the standards of project completeness would be in steady decline as lower and lower levels of quality became more and more acceptable.

I imagine that in such a society projects of significant scale and difficulty (and long timetables) would struggle to get started, regardless of their societal importance, as that society collectively and indefinitely procrastinates important work that does not immediately reward those who bring it to fruition.

I imagine that in such a society the cost of those significant projects would grow higher and higher as those involved view the project as merely an opportunity to extract some immediate short-term gain with no concern for its success or failure.

I imagine that such a society might find authoritarianism's "ruthless efficiency" increasingly appealing (due to trends in perception, not reality).

I imagine that in such a society the average attention span would be measurably decreasing and that the appearance of productivity would become aspirational as people share their minutely detailed schedules on social media, emphasizing the lack of "wasted time."

And I imagine that in such a society there would be no agreement whatsoever on what the point of such productivity might be, only an agreement that the appearance of it is important and good.

I think our society is that society, and so I think looking productive has become the yardstick of society. And because I think that, I think society regards thinking as a bad thing.

Amusingly, in our society, it has become perfectly acceptable to allocate some time every day for the universally agreed to be an important and healthy activity- meditation/mindfulness practice. Of course, only if it's for 10-15 minutes once a day in a carefully scheduled time slot; anything longer is slovenly!

What is this specially allowed period of sitting and seemingly doing nothing? It is, and I will be criticized for this oversimplified definition, but nonetheless- it is practicing not thinking for a while.

Now, this is a bit unfair and disparaging of mindfulness practice. There is a consensus in the scientific community that this practice benefits mental health, and most I know would argue it is practicing not thinking harmful thoughts, not no thoughts- while keeping thoughts focused.

But I couldn't help myself because now, if I were to develop a new mindfulness app, I would certainly advertise it along the lines of, "Mindfulness- just ten minutes a day can save you more than twenty minutes a day of thought!"

And I do find it amusing how easy a time society had of accepting the practice of not-thinking, usually undertaken to reduce the impact thought has on productivity throughout the day. It makes perfect sense to me that society had an easy time swallowing that pill- managing thought can be a major challenge for anybody!

So why not advertise thought in much the same way? "Thought- just ten minutes a day can save you more than twenty minutes a day of wasted effort!" Why not allocate time every day to just think and nothing else? You can even narrow its definition: focused unharmful thought.

As you have seen, my answer is that thinking looks unproductive and looking unproductive is bad.

I do realize my case seems more like advocating for a new societal yardstick, but I regard such a task as being akin to trying to move the sun- certainly a pointless project. It seems easier to sneak thinking under the tent flap guarding what is seen as being productive.

Imagine if highly productive people were people spending a lot of time thinking through their actions, thinking through the purpose of their exertions, thinking through the costs, benefits, consequences- everything? Wouldn't a society of such thinking, highly productive people undo most of the damage a society of unthinking, highly productive people had done?

Now remember, I am just a guy writing an Amazon review on the human condition, not a human-condition-engineer, but nonetheless, I do humbly suggest that the human condition would be improved considerably if time spent thinking was regarded by most as productive time spent.
