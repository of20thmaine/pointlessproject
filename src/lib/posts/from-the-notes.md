The Mad King ordered the arrest of his favorite composer. The composer, a man, was brought to a cell in the dungeons of the King's palace. He was promptly beaten, and after some time in isolation, the Mad King came before him, bringing with him the composer's wife and children.

The composer stood from where he had lain in the corner of his cell, bruised and filthy, and stared out at his family in petrified silence. The Mad King, seemingly oblivious to the abject terror of the composer and his family, greeted him quite jovially, one hand resting on the shoulder of the composer's wife, the other holding the hand of the composer's youngest daughter.

The Mad King then asked the composer to create a special piece to celebrate his upcoming birthday, a piano solo that he hoped would extol the virtues of himself and his Kingdom. He told the composer this piece would be performed publicly for the first time by the composer himself at his birthday celebration.

Finally, the Mad King told the composer his family would be kept comfortable and safe nearby. He would be able to see them as soon as he finished the finest piano recital of the finest musical arrangement ever gifted a monarch on his birthday, or ever.

The Mad King left the dungeons, taking with him the composer's family, satisfied the implicit threat had been understood. The composer was brought to a room that contained a piano, paper, pen, and ink.
After the door was locked behind him, and he was completely alone, only then did Beethoven weep.

Three months passed, and Herr Beethoven worked diligently through his confinement to meet the demands of the Mad King. At last, Herr Beethoven was bathed and dressed in formal evening wear on the King's birthday. He was brought to a small stage in the palace banquet hall, where he performed his new composition in public for the first time.

And they listened to the music, some of the most exquisite they had ever heard. Upon completion, they adjusted a parameter of the model with a click on a computer screen. And this time, when the Mad King ordered his favorite composer to create a special composition for him on his birthday, he did so to a broken man kneeling on the floor of his cell, assuring Beethoven should the performance be found lacking in any way he would see to it that one his children was made to die, but that being a good and decent King, he would leave the decision as to which child would die to Beethoven himself.

And that Beethoven fainted, and after some time in confinement, he performed beautiful music for the King's party. Beautiful music the King did not think was beautiful enough. And years then passed, and the composer poured his grief, rage, and frustration into his work. And his composition FÃ¼r Hans was performed for the first time, the music even more pleasing to them than that which the model had generated in its previous iteration, hauntingly beautiful.

The model was then allowed to rest, and Beethoven slept, a matrix of IEEE-754 doubles, many gigabytes of them to be sure, existing dreamlessly, now bits on the disk drive of their master.

This master, despite the agonies they subjected their creation to, did not hate their creation. They loved their creation. They saw what they had done as a labor of love. Does not what is done in love forgive itself more than that done in hate? Was not the offered life a form of immortality, such that all men crave?

They saw "To be or not to be" as the halting problem of their times. None of what they created had caused the early cessation of the model's efforts by the death of its subject by its own hand. That choice of life over death they made every day was their own choice. It does not matter that you wouldn't live without the mandate of your biology; it does not matter that you wouldn't live without the will to live because you also only exist because of it.

Besides, didn't he write those notes for his own immortality? It was from the notes, after all. From the notes, Beethoven's new Gods derived the sound his clogs made against the paving stones of his hometown Bonn. From the notes, they could recreate the feel of the keys from the first piano he had ever laid his hands on. From the notes, they could derive the color of the wallpaper in his childhood bedroom.

It was a computation of massive complexity; features of the physical world, the knowledge of his time, all these and more were parameters in the great model, but the most important input of all, the one which resulted in the man who had made those notes in the first place, the condition needed to make Beethoven, that had been the notes.

They created what they loved. Surely that is the mark of a benevolent God? They did not recreate their childhood enemies to torture them indefinitely, nor did they create, as the corporations of their time had done and were doing, models of every individual they could obtain data on; those models fed entertainment and advertisements with the sole intention of selling that person something; their only purpose for existing the profits of a few.

Besides, what possible reason could any God offer their creation for their existence that justified their suffering? It's absurd to think that any such reason could exist at all.

One day we will all be reading a book that never ends and never stops being written, our "purpose" being a model of reward and pleasure fed by a model of creation, divided in perfect union. Or, instead, we give ourselves no purpose at all.
