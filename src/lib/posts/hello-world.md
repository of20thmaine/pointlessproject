Hello world! I'm Bobby, the creator of Pointless Project. While I'm tempted to say this site has no purpose for existing, that wouldn't quite be true.

When I was younger, I found pleasure in writing every day- sometimes essays about things happening around me, occasionally short stories I hoped would entertain and amuse others. When I turned 30 (a recent development), I realized I had allowed years to pass where I wrote hardly anything at all.

That is why I created this site, so I have a place and a reason to write where it could be discovered by you, the reader, and hopefully, entertain/amuse/maybe even sometimes inform you, outcomes I find personally fulfilling.

Also, it's important to note here that nothing I write on this site, even when I write about things I think are true and explain why; none of it is being written from the perspective of a recognized intellectual authority.

Instead, I write from the same soapbox on which any charlatan can give rambling speeches to the people. Even my little credibility from my lowly bachelor's degree in computer science does little to inform my writings on that subject.

I hope you the reader treats these writings accordingly- the output of someone who is basically a carnival barker with too much time on their hands. In return, I promise to read all criticism with an open mind and amend any writings I no longer agree with my new position and the reasoning for why/how my mind was changed.

The direction this site goes will be determined by my passion for learning. I will share everything I discover as I meander down the path of what is unknown to me, never claiming to shed new light in any of the areas explored, only observing and remarking on my thoughts on what I see.

-Bobby
